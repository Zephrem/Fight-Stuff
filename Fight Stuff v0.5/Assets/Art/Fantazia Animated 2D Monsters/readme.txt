In order for this asset to work, you need to download spine-unity package:
http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity-download
To use the asset just drag one of the prefabs from "Prefabs" folder and put it on the scene (you might need to change the x and y scale if the monster is too small for your game)

You can easily manipulate the prefabs and skeletons. Things you can do by using spine:
-On animation complete function (Example: give the player loot and gold when the death animation is completed)
-On event function (All the monsters have "OnDamaging" event that is triggered when the attack animation reaches the damaging position. For example, when the skeleton sword reaches the player, you can trigger damage taking function)
-Generate transforms that follow the skeleton of the monster. (Example: attaching a collider on the sword of the skeleton and call OnTriggerEnter2D when it hits an object)
-And much much more (check this page for all the functionality of Spine in Unity http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-unity)



If you notice some weird gray lines in the monsters then that means your Color Space is not set to Gamma, to change it then do the following:
Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering > Color Space to Gamma
